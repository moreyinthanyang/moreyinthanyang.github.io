subtitle: 'What More Yin and Yang is About'

Welcome to my first blog post. Well, first post on this website, at least. More Yin Than Yang is not only a blog, but also a YouTube channel about Germany. Behind More Yin Than Yang is me, a girl from Hong Kong, who is about to move to Germany. 

The whole point of this is to document my journey of moving and living in Germany. Who knows what will happen from here on out? 

I also want to see if I can be consistent enought to build this from nothing into something. 


Have a good one.
