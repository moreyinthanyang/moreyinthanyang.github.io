So I decided to start a YouTube channel and this little blog about Germany. Behind More Yin Than Yang is me, a girl from Hong Kong, who is at the time of writing this, about to move to Germany. 

The whole point of this is to document my journey of moving and living in Germany. Who knows what will happen from here on out? 

I also want to see if I can be consistent enought to build this from nothing into something. 

Have a good one.
