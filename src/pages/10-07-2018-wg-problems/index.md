This video is about my personal experiences of living in a WG (shared housing) in Germany and the problems that occurred during that time. 

I've only lived in a WG for a month while studying German at a language school in Frankfurt in August 2018, but that alone was already enough for me to understand what the WG life is all about. 

There are both good and bad things about the WG I lived in, but this video mostly focuses on the problems, because it's important to be aware of the issues that COULD arise when you're living with strangers and it's also important to resolve them. 

When living with strangers, you should expect to tolerate a lot of the things that may annoy you, but obviouly you should also take your own stand and confront them if what they're doing is starting to get ridiculous (i.e. standing on the toilet seat with dirty shoes on).

I hope you enjoyed watching the video as much as I enjoyed making it and best of luck in finding your ideal accommodation.
