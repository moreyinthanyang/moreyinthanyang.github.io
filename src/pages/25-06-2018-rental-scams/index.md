I made this video to warn everyone about the apartment rental scams that are going on in Germany, especially for housing in bigger cities such as Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Hamburg etc. This topic came to my attention, as someone tried to scam me when I was looking for an apartment to rent online through a reputable site. 

In this video, I explain what happend and I also show you all the scammy emails that were sent to me so that you can hopefully recognize when you're being scammed. 

If you're a foreigner with little to no German knowledge and you can't personally show up to apartment viewings, you are extra susceptible to these scams! Luckily for me, this scammer wasn't very convincing - but always keep your guard up (especially when you're desperate) because the good scammers can be really authentic, and people <i>do</i> actually fall for them. 

In the end of the video, I share some general tips on how you can determine whether or not someone is trying to scam you. I know that it's difficult to find housing in Germany since it's becoming increasingly scarce right now, so all the best.
