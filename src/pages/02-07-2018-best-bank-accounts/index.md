In this video I recommend you the German bank accounts that I think are the best for international students and foreigners. To make it clear, by bank account, I mean a Girokonto, which is the equivalent of a current account. If you're looking for a savings account, that's called a Tagesgeldkonto in German and that's something else.

Please do your own research when deciding on a bank because it's not an insignificant decision. There are so many different and specific offers out there so make sure you know exactly what you're signing up for. This is important because if you always change your bank account, it will negatively affect your Schufa Auskunft (German credit score).
