Luckily for me, this scammer wasn\'t very convincing - but always keep your guard up (especially when you\'re desperate) because the good scammers can be really authentic, and people <i>do</i> actually fall for them. </p>\n<p>In the end of the video, I share some general tips on how you can determine whether or not someone is trying to scam you. I know that it\'s difficult to find housing in Germany since it\'s becoming increasingly scarce right now, so all the best. </p>',frontmatter:{date:"June 25, 2018",path:"/germany-rental-scams",title:"Apartment Rental Scams in Germany",subtitle:"My personal experiences with an online scammer"}}},pathContext:{}}}});
